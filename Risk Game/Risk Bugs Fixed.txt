Change the definition of the structure to make it compatible with the new manager.dll (previously fewer than 10 cards were supported.  It is possible for a player to have 10 cards in RISK in a rare circumstance.)
struct CARD_DATA
{
	int wCountry[10];
	int cardType[10]; // 0 = wild, 1 = soldier, 2 = horse, 3 = cannon
};
Add the following function to your DLL if you want:
extern "C" void __stdcall TurnComplete(int PlayerID)
{
	// This will be called at the end of each opponent's turn.  
	// This gives this DLL the opportunity to make any observations about 
	// how the board has changed after each opponent's turn.
	// Implementing anything in this function is entirely optional.
}

Bugs fixed: (12-15-2001)
1)  Only allows reinforcements to adjacent countries
2)  Removes correct cards during a trade-in
3)  Allows you to make more than one trade in if you have more than 5 cards
4)  Does not allow the computer to leave less than one army after taking a country
(this is why there would be countries with 0 or negative armies in some cases on the board)
5)  Does not call the MakeMove function twice before the first roll when attacking a country

What was added?

1)  Functions to find out the number of wins another player already has (if playing in a tournament)
2)  Function which is called at the end of every players turn (besides your own) so that you can see how the game is changing, who's attacking, who's not
