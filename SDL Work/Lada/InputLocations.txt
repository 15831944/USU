Input Locations can now be collected in two ways, essentially blocking and non-blocking:
UpdateGraphTimer,GetILDataTimer, will continue to use the same non-blocking method.
This is important so as to not harm user responsiveness.
However, all places that use GetInputLocation or ExecuteICommand or SetLocationAndVerify
will now be changed to use the new and improved GetInputLocations function...
