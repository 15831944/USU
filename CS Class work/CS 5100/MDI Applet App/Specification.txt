CS 5100 - Spring, 2002 - Assignment 5

This assignment will be to create a multiple document text editor running as 
an applet.  The software will be tested by running it in the applet viewer.

There will be a combo box listing five different fonts.  Selecting a font will 
change the font in which a document is displayed or, if a section of the 
document is selected, it will change the font in which that section is 
displayed.  Font display characteristics will not persist if a document is 
saved to a file and then reopened.

A selected section of the text can be dragged to another location.  If the 
control key is not depressed, then the selection will be moved.  If the control 
key is depressed, then the selection will be copied.  Appropriate icons will 
be shown to display dragging and distinguish between a move and a copy.

Each separate document will appear in a separate internal frame, with a title 
equal to the file name, if the document has been saved, or to "Untitled = N", 
where each new document created during a single execution of the editor 
will have N= 1, 2, 3... 

Each of the menu operations will operate in the standard fashion, with the 
exception of Close.  There will be a File menu with New, Open, Save, Save 
As, Close, Print, Exit.  The Close selection will pop up a dialog containing a 
list of all titles of open documents.  Then the user will be able to select those 
documents he/she wants to close using the multiple discontiguous selection 
model.  Clicking OK will cause these document frames to be close.  There 
will be an Edit menu with Cut, Copy, Paste, Select All, Find, Replace.  
There will be a Window menu, which will show the title of each internal 
frame's document.  

The entire application, as well as all internal frames, can be closed, resized, 
maximized, or minimized.  There will be a warning before closing (by the 
frame close or the File menu Close selection) a document with modifications 
which haven't been saved.
