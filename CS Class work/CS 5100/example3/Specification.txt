CS 5100 Spring, 2000
Fifth Homework Assignment
Due April 14

The purpose of this assignment is to provide a tool for users to choose a set of four colors that
go well together.  This is much the same as homework 3, except that it will be done in Visual 
C++.  You may want to look at the Java code for the solution to homework 3, which is in the
assignment3 directory.

Your application will display four areas, each having a common boundary with each of the other three.  
Initially, they will be colored red, green, blue, and white.  The user may change the color of
any one of these areas by double-clicking within it.  This should pop up a window containing
three scrollbars with accompanying text fields; one for the red component of the area color, one for
the green, and one for the blue.  The text fields will have a number from 0 to 255 indicating the
current setting of the associated scrollbar.  The user should be able to change the color of the area
that was double-clicked by scrolling the scrollbar, or by typing a new number in the text field, 
followed by a return.  After such an event, a new color will be constructed based on the RGB 
components represented by the scrollbar/textfield values, and the associated area will be redrawn
in that color.  Make sure that all four colors can be simultaneously edited.  That is to say, the
user should not have to close a window or click an "Accept" button, or anything similar, to proceed
to edit another color.  It should simply be possible to double-click the other color's area and have
another window with scrollbars and text fields pop up for it.  These should also be real windows,
which the user can position anywhere on the screen.
