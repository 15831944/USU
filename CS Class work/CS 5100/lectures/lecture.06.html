<OL>

<LI>Display optimization can improve both efficiency and accuracy.  In an experiment, optimization resulted in a decrease of 31% in the time required to complete a task, and 28% in the error rate.</LI>
<LI>It is a standard principle of information organization to group related information.  This can be done by using the principles of proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, and symmetry:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>boxing with borders, or even putting information in independent windows, for proximity;</LI>
<LI>using color to create similarity and contrasting color to create organizational distance;</LI>
<LI>allowing organizational structure to be completed by the mind with closure; a simple example is creating a solid line with a sequence of dashes -----------------</LI>
<LI>letting geometric flow give organization, as with a sequence of increasingly smaller rectangles;</LI>
<LI>placing data in the shape of recognized symmetric figures, typically rectangles, with surrounding blank space.</LI></OL>

<LI>Where information arranged in columns or sections must be fitted into a scrolling viewport, repeat column headings in each viewport screen.  In a similar way, multipage displays should be individually identified.</LI>
<LI>Narrative information takes 66% more time to understand than structured information.</LI>
<LI>Crowded information (30% blank surrounding 70% data) takes 45% more time to understand than isolated information (30% data within 70% blank).</LI>
<LI>Extraneous information slows comprehension.</LI></OL>

<LI>Presentation</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Be sure that presentation is always consistent as to organization, font, color, shape, etc.</LI>
<LI>Build interfaces which query platforms about aspect ratio, size, colormap limitations, font availablilty, etc., and then react accordingly.</LI>
<LI>Present numeric data graphically when it is highly voluminous, dynamic, continuous, or used for comparison.  Present it textually when it is small, static, discrete, or must be interpreted individually.</LI>
<LI>Even for expert users, increasing the number of options to select from decreases efficiency.  Hick’s Law says selection time is proportional to the log of the number of options.</LI>
<LI>Encoding options</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Size can be used when the larger is more than 50% bigger than the smaller.  Typically 3 to 5 sizes can be used effectively.</LI>
<LI>Up to 20 different shapes (icon profiles) can be used.</LI>
<LI>Up to 10 different colors, and up to 4 different brightness levels can be used.</LI>
<LI>Up to 11 different angles can be used.</LI>
<LI>Line lengths should be limited to 4, widths to 3, and styles (solid, dashed) to 9.</LI></OL>

<LI>Blink rates should be 2 to 5 hertz, with more than 50% of the cycle displaying the information.</LI>
<LI>There are a variety of ergonomic standards, for instance, ISO 9241, which give physical measurements and organizations for interaction.</LI></OL>

<LI>Color</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Be conservative, and try to use professionally chosen color schemes.</LI>
<LI>Always design the interface in monochrome first, so that it will be comprehensible to the 8% of American and West European males who are color blind.  This also makes the interface robust on different displays.</LI>
<LI>Certain combinations - like saturated red and saturated blue, yellow and purple, magenta and green - do not provide comprehensible contrast.</LI>
<LI>Other combinations - like blue and green, yellow and white, brown and black, green and white - are hard to see.</LI>
<LI>Some effective contrasts are white and black, blue and yellow, yellow and black.</LI>
<LI>There may be less color fidelity between displays than you would think.</LI></OL>

<LI>Text Metrics</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Density - Percent of positions filled</LI>
<LI>Local density - number of positions filled (weighted by distance from the center) in a circle subtending 5 degrees of view</LI>
<LI>Layout complexity - information theoretic distribution of data by horizontal and vertical distance.  This can be minimized by indented rectangular structures.</LI>
<LI>These metrics can be used to improve both efficiency and user friendliness</LI>
<LI>The Hawthorne effect must be taken into account.  It says that there will be an improvement in subjectively measured satisfaction no matter what you do, because people are pleased to be involved in an experiment, trying something new.</LI></OL>
