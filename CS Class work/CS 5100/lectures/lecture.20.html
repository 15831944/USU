</I></FONT><LI>AWTEvents</LI>
<OL>

<LI>The AWT events include both container and component events.  Since handling is very similar, even though the semantics are different, they are treated together here.</LI>
<LI>It becomes very important in building an application to understand what events might be generated by the objects.  While there is too much to memorize, it is good to try to get a general idea.</LI></OL>

<LI>Component events are generic for all components.  Specific components will generate additional events under specific conditions.</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants: Event subtypes are shown, hidden, resized, added.</LI>
<LI>Method: getComponent identifies which component generated the event.</LI></OL>

<LI>Container describes interactions between containers and their child components. Container events are generic for all containers.</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants: There are event subtype constants indicating child added and child removed</LI>
<LI>Methods: getContainer (where it happened) and getChild (which one caused it)</LI></OL>

<LI>Focus deals with change in keyboard focus at the component level.  Changes can be temporary, due to deactivation or scrolling or mouse exit, or permanent, due to program or user generated actions.  Temporary changes will be undone when scrolling stops or the window is reactivated.</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Only one component can have focus at a time.  Focus can be changed by mouse clicks or program action, or traversed by the tab key or program action.</LI>
<LI>There is frequently a visual signal (shading, highlighting, etc. ) of the component with focus.</LI>
<LI>Constants: There are constants indicated that focus was gained or lost</LI>
<LI>Method: isTemporary</LI></OL>

<LI>Input events are an abstract class and embrace both key and mouse events.  </LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants: Masks for modifier keys and mouse buttons</LI>
<LI>Methods:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>consume, isConsumed</LI>
<LI>is[modifier]Down tells whether each of the four modifier keys was down when the event occurred.  isShiftDown, for instance, tells whether the user wanted to indicate an upper case or lower case letter.</LI>
<LI>getWhen gets the time of the event</LI>
<LI>getModifiers gets a combined mask for all modifiers. These include alt, shift, control, meta, and the three mouse buttons.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<LI>Key events deal with user keyboard actions</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>There are different Virtual Key constants, like VK_LEFT, which is associated with the left cursor key or VK_F3 for the function 3 key.  Some keys are &quot;action&quot; keys, like the cursor control, function, and special keypad keys.  </LI>
<LI>There are constants indicating three event subtypes: key pressed, key released, and key typed.  Typing only occurs for keys that represent characters, that is, non-action keys.</LI></OL>

<LI>Methods</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>getKeyChar returns the character associated with a typeable, non-action key.  </LI>
<LI>getKeyCode returns the virtual key code for the key used. This method does not work for KEY_TYPED events.</LI>
<LI>GetKeyModifiersText returns a string (&quot;Alt+Shift&quot;) describing which modifier keys were down.</LI>
<LI>GetKeyText returns a string (&quot;Home&quot;) describing which key was pressed.</LI>
<LI>There are methods to set the code, char, and modifiers.  These are useful when we want to do things like automatically show all characters in uppercase, or show password characters as asterisks.</LI>
<LI>The isAction method tells whether the key pressed was an action key.</LI>
<LI>Since most components are not interested in keystrokes, AWT doesn’t even bother to deliver key events to them.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<LI>Mouse events deal with mouse clicks and movements</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Masks for mouse pressed, released, and clicked</LI>
<LI>Masks for mouse moved and dragged</LI>
<LI>Masks to indicate a mouse entered, or exited, the bounding rectangle of an object</LI></OL>

<LI>Methods</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>getX and getY indicated the (relative) coordinates at which the mouse event occurred.  getPoint returns the same information as a point.</LI>
<LI>isPopupTrigger indicates whether the mouse action should pop up the menu associated with the object where the event occurred</LI>
<LI>getClickCount tells how many clicks occurred within the double-click period</LI></OL>

<LI>There is no separate MouseMotionEvent, even though there are corresponding Listeners and Adapters, each of which is specialized to handling certain kinds of the above events.  In Swing, there is a MouseInputListener interface which does both, but no corresponding add method.</LI></OL>

<LI>Paint events include anything, like exposure, which causes a component to be repainted.  Application programs don’t handle paint events directly.  This is done internally by AWT.</LI>
<LI>Action represents clicking a button or hitting the enter key when they trigger an action</LI><OL>

<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Constants: there are masks indicating which modifier keys (shift, alt, control, meta) were in effect at the time of the action</LI>
<LI>Methods</LI>
<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>getModifiers</LI>
<LI>getActionCommand returns the logical, language-independent action command associated with this event</LI></OL>
</OL>
</OL>

<LI>Adjustment deals with scrollbar events</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants: There are constants indicating unit down or up, block down or up, or block drag</LI>
<LI>Methods</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>getAdjustable returns the adjustable object in which the event occurred</LI>
<LI>getValue returns the current value (scrollbar scale setting)</LI>
<LI>getAdjustmentType returns one of the constants, indicating the kind of event</LI></OL>
</OL>

<LI>Item events relate to the selection of an item in a list.  Item events are semantic events which are generated by objects which implement the ItemSelectable interface.   Besides adding and removing listeners the interface dictates a method to getSelectedObjects.  Checkbox, CheckboxMenuItem, Choice and List are all selectable.</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants: there are constants indicating that an item’s state was changed, and that the state change was either a selection or deselection</LI>
<LI>Method</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>getItemSelectable indicates the list in which the event occurred</LI>
<LI>getItem returns an object, usually a string, which describes the selected item</LI>
<LI>getStateChange, returns either the selection or deselection constant</LI></OL>
</OL>

<LI>Window events are those that are associated with the appearance and disappearance of windows on the desktop.</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Constants</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Masks for iconified and deiconified, that is the collapse of a window into an icon on the taskbar or desktop, or its restoration</LI>
<LI>Masks for activated and deactivated, that is bringing the window to the front, or replacing it at the front with another window</LI>
<LI>Masks for window opened, closing, and closed.  Closing refers to events in which the user requests the window be closed, closed refers to the ultimate closure of the window.  Closing is an appropriate time to dispose of window resources.</LI></OL>

<LI>getWindow returns the window which generated the event.</LI></OL>

<LI>Text events are very simple.  There is a TEXT_VALUE_CHANGED constant and a paramString method.  There is a much more complex text package in Swing.</LI>
<LI>Custom Events can be created using id numbers above the last id number reserved for the system.  This can happen when we create our own components, or when we want to communicate between threads.</LI>
<LI>Swing Events</LI>
<OL>

<LI>These tend to be semantic rather than component events.  Remember that Swing components can still generate and handle many AWT events.</LI>
<LI>There are also four Swing events which are actually in the AWT package hierarchy.</LI>
<LI>Ancestor events deal with occasions when something happens to a component’s ancestor.</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Subevent type constants for ancestor added, removed, or moved.</LI>
<LI>Methods to get the component generating the event, the ancestor of that component which was added, removed, or moved, and the parent of the ancestor.</LI></OL>

<LI>Caret events deal with the caret position in text, which is sometimes different from the cursor position.  For instance, if we are carrying out a selection, the original position is the &quot;mark&quot; and the current position is the &quot;dot&quot;.  The caret represents the position at which an input would occur.  The two methods get the mark and the dot.</LI>
<LI>Change events occur when an object changes state.  Thus in the Swing hierarchy, it is used instead of a selection event for JCheckboxes.  There are no constants and methods.</LI>
<LI>Hyperlink events are generated in editor panes using the HTML editor kit when the cursor enters, leaves, or activates a hyperlink.</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Constants: Subevent ids for entered, exited, and activated.</LI>
<LI>Methods: getDescription (a string for the URL), getURL, getType</LI></OL>

<LI>InternalFrame events mirror those for regular frames (activated, iconified, etc.) but apply to events that occur in internal frames.  For instance, we might have a multiple document interface, say an editor with multiple documents open, and want to iconify the frame for a particular document and select another.</LI></OL>
