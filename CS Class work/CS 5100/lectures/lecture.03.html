<LI>Human mental processes</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Short-term memory permits instant, effortless access to about 7 chunks of information.</LI>
<LI>Long-term memory permits associative, slow access to an unlimited amount of information.</LI>
<LI>Problem solving uses awareness of a limited number of strategies.</LI>
<LI>Decision making involves assessment of risk, effort, cost, benefit, etc. With the intention of maximizing some payoff formula while minimizing some payout formula.</LI>
<LI>Attention and set relates to the volatility of short-term memory.</LI>
<LI>Search and scanning uses perceptual and pattern matching skills, along with search strategies.</LI>
<LI>Time perception tells us of the passage of time.</LI></OL>

<LI>Factors which may affect mental performance</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Arousal, fatigue, monotony</LI>
<LI>Perceptual load</LI>
<LI>Comfort, distraction</LI>
<LI>Anxiety, fear</LI></OL>

<LI>Knowledge categories</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Syntactic knowledge relates to conventions and rules for which there is no good reason.</LI>
<LI>Semantic knowledge relates to facts and procedural concepts.  It is usually organized hierarchically, and may relate either to the problem domain or to computer systems.</LI></OL>

<LI>Familiarity reduces anxiety and fear while improving comfort.  For this reason, the use of familiar metaphors has a positive effect on users.  However, since users may read more into the metaphor than we have programmed, they can also be somewhat dangerous.</LI></OL>

<LI>How to create interfaces for users</LI>
<OL>

<LI>Start with measurable goals, such as</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>How much time should be required for typical users to learn the system?</LI>
<LI>How long should it take typical users to carry out a set of benchmark tasks?</LI>
<LI>How many of what kinds of user errors can be permitted?</LI>
<LI>How well do users retain their knowledge of system use after a day, or week, or month?</LI>
<LI>How do users rate the system subjectively?</LI></OL>

<LI>Spend a significant time developing user profiles:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Skill levels</LI>
<LI>Training levels, </LI>
<LI>Frequency of system use</LI>
<LI>Tasks</LI>
<LI>Preferences</LI>
<LI>Priorities</LI>
<LI>Willingness and tolerance</LI></OL>

<LI>Analyze tasks so as to determine atomic tasks, then put them together in scenarios or threads to implement all tasks.</LI>
<LI>Build into your interface the following attributes:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Consistency</LI>
<LI>Power-user shortcuts</LI>
<LI>Informative feedback; make sure that there are no hidden traps in the system state</LI>
<LI>Dialogs which impose modality</LI>
<LI>Disabling of choices which will generate errors, or at least warnings.</LI>
<LI>Easy reversal of actions</LI>
<LI>Reduction of short-term memory load</LI></OL>

<LI>In connection with error-blocking, consider how a wimp interface eliminates many of the common errors of command language interfaces:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Modal errors (doing something inappropriate at the moment) are avoided by disabling menu selections and imposing modal dialogs.</LI>
<LI>Description errors (forgetting how to formulate a command) are avoided by the menu mechanism.</LI>
<LI>Activation errors (forgetting what to do next while in the midst of a sequence of actions) are avoided by cascading menus and modal dialogs.</LI>
<LI>Capture errors (executing a memorized sequence of actions inappropriate for the moment) are avoided by disabling menu selections and modal dialogs.</LI></OL>

<LI>Carry out extensive prototyping</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>Storyboarding</LI>
<LI>Concept (paper)</LI>
<LI>Design (paint)</LI>
<LI>Animation (toolbook)</LI>
<LI>Prototype (target UIDS)</LI>
<LI>Final product</LI></OL>
